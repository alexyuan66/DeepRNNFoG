Alexander M. Yuan's project: Using Deep Learning to Predict Freezing of Gait 
in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.

This project is supervised by Professor Shayok Chakraborty at Florida State 
University. Different programs to repreduce the results in paper:

Vishwas G. Torvi, Aditya Bhattacharya, and Shayok Chakraborty, "Deep Domain 
Adaptation to Predict Freezing of Gait in Patients with Parkinson's Disease," 
IEEE ICMLA 2018.

The baseline code is provided by Prof. Chakraborty. The code no longer 
works in the current version of python and tensorflow. Rewrote the code 
to generate X and Y arrays for training set and testing set, use Keras 
instead of tensorflow to build the RNN network.
